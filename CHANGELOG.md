    - wfa-go: add a new flag `-t` for only showing the aligned region.
- v0.3.1
    - use a more efficient data structure to store cigar operations.
    - slight speed improvement.
- v0.3.0
    - faster speed and lower memory simply by changing the default value of `OFFSETS_BASE_SIZE` from 2048 to 128.
    - setting `WAVEFRONTS_BASE_SIZE` and `OFFSETS_BASE_SIZE` as global variables, not constants.
- v0.2.3
    - fix adaptive reduction.
- v0.2.2
